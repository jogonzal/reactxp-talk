# REACTXP talk

Cross platform
Android, iOS, Windows UWP, Mac: React native
Web: ReactJS
Windows7-8, Linux: ReactJS

Common code (Typescript)
- View definitions, animations, event handling, data stores, networking, core app logic

## Benefits
Main benefit is you get native components and mobile platform support. You may choose a react native just for mobile and have electron apps for all desktop experiences.

## Jorge's opinion
Makes more sense to go web everywhere and then handle native as a one-off
